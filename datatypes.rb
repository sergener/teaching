# In Ruby, your information can come in different types. There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now: numbers, booleans (which can be true or false), and strings (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").

# 1. Strings are words or phrases wrapped in parentheses.
# Write something to be your string. Don't forget your parentheses!
puts my_string = 

# 2. Whole numbers in Ruby are called integers.
# set an integer as your number.
puts my_number = 

# 3. Booleans are binary variables, which means they only have two variables.
# In Ruby's case, there are two possible values called “true” and “false.”
# Set a boolean
puts my_boolean = 

#Test if Ruby is judging your variable correctly!



# One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is the variable. You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value. For example, let's say you needed the number 25 from our last example, but you're not going to use it right away. You can set a variable, say my_num, to grasp the value 25 and hang onto it for later use, like this:

# my_num = 25

# Declaring variables in Ruby is easy: you just write out a name like my_num, use = to assign it a value, and you're done! If you need to change a variable, no sweat: just type it again and hit = to assign it a new value.
