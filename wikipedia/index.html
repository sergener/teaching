				<p class="left">Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809 in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County, Kentucky. As a youth, Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.", and must have done it to avoid manual labor. </p>

			<h2 id="presidency" class="left">Presidency</h2>
				<p class="left">On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States.</p>

			<h2 id="legacy" class="left">Legacy</h2>
				<p class="left">In surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty.</p>
