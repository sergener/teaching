# There are four arithmetic operators we'll work with today:

# Addition (+)
# Subtraction (-)
# Multiplication (*)
# Division (/)


# 1. Add two numbers together


# 2. Subtract two numbers


# 3. Multiply 2 numbers


# 4. Divide two numbers


# 5. Experiment! What happens when you use multiple operators in different orders?
#    Does Ruby do the math in the correct order?
