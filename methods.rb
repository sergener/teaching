# Methods are summoned using a .

# If you have a string, "I love ice cream", and take the .length of it, Ruby will return the length of the string (that is, the number of charactersâ€”letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols). The code will look something like this:

# my_variable = "I love ice cream"

# puts my_variable.length

# Try it out yourself!

# 1. Create a new string variable using your name
my_name = "Alkis"
friend = "Hudson"
x = "my name is "
number = "5"

# 2. Check the length of your name:


# 3. Another method is .reverse. What do you think this method does? Try it out!


# 4. Two more methods are .upcase and .downcase. Let's try them and see what they do to your name!




# There are a lot of other methods you can use! Another is .times. This will let you do something the amount of times you tell it to. If I wanted to print my variable 20 times, I would write:

# 20.times do
# 	puts my_variable
# end

# Try it yourself!

# 1. Create a new variable with a greeting

# 2. How many times do you want to print the greeting?
