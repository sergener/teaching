// Consider a program that prints all even numbers from 0 to 12. One way to write this is as follows:

console.log(0);
console.log(2);
console.log(4);
console.log(6);
console.log(8);
console.log(10);
console.log(12);


// var number = 0;
// while (number <= 12) {
//   console.log(number);
//   number = number + 2;
// }

 // This is a program that calculates and shows the value of 2e10 (2 to the 10th power). We use two variables: one to keep track of our result and one to count how often we have multiplied this result by 2. The loop tests whether the second variable has reached 10 yet and then updates both variables.

// var result = 1;
// var counter = 0;
// while (counter < 10) {
//   result = result * 2;
//   counter = counter + 1;
// }
// console.log(result);
