// This program illustrates the break statement. It finds the first number that is both greater than or equal to 20 and divisible by 7.

// for (var current = 20; ; current++) {
//   if (current % 7 == 0)
//     break;
// }
// console.log(current);
// // â†’ 21
// Using the remainder (%) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. If it is, the remainder of their division is zero.
